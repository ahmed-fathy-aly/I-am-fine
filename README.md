I am fine
=======

How it works
-------------------
- Search for a user
- click "How are you?"
- that user receives a notification whenever someone asks about him
- The user clicks "I am fine", so those concerned will know he's fine

Why ?
--------
Sometimes you don't have much more to say. 
And it seemed perfect for udacity's nano degree capstone project

Current progress
----------------
The Android app with basic functionality is ready but I am still working on implementing the backend

Current Features implemented in the App's side
---------------------------------------------
- Sign up and Log in with email
- Search for a user and ask if he's fine
- Instant notification when a user asks about you
- Cache data about users who asked about you on the device's local database

Features to be implemented in the future
----------------------------------------
- Sign up with Facebook
- Sign up with G+
- optimize the design for tablets
- improve the display for viewing the users who asked about you
- Suggest the users who are nearby

How to build
------------
No special setup steps needed, It will run normally with Android studio
